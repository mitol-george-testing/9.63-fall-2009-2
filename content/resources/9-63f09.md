description: Statistically-analyzed PET scan data superimposed on structural MRI scan
  (front of brain is at right) shows areas in the anterior and posterior cingulate
  where panic disorder patients had nearly one third fewer serotonin 5-HT1A receptors
  compared to healthy control subjects. The lighter the color, the greater the difference
  between patients and controls. (Image courtesy of the National Institute of Mental
