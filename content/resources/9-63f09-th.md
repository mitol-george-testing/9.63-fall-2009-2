  (front of brain is at right) shows areas in the anterior and posterior cingulate
  where panic disorder patients had nearly one third fewer serotonin 5-HT1A receptors
  compared to healthy control subjects. The lighter the color, the greater the difference
  between patients and controls. (Image courtesy of the National Institute of Mental
