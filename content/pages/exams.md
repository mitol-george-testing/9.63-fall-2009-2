Mid Term Exam General Rules
---------------------------

To receive the full 20% grade, you need to sum up 100 points. With the extra credit question (see at the end), the maximum score of the exam is 110. This means the extra 10 points will cover any lost points in any other questions. You do not have to answer the questions in order.
